# nonogramcsharp
Initially written as a React/JS application for my final project at Codeclan. 
This is a rewrite in C#
Nonograms are np hard and therefore cannot be solved completely by logic along. 
Most solvers you see online are of the 'brute force' type which check every possible combination.
Since the puzzles can have upwards of 3000 cells, this approach is rather resource heavy.
So, this code attempts to model how a human would solve the puzzles.
